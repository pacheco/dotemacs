in isearch mode.  The point of this function is that oftentimes
you want to delete some portion of text, one end of which happens
to be an active isearch word. The observation to make is that if
you use isearch a lot to move the cursor around (as you should,
it is much more efficient than using the arrows), it happens a
lot that you could just delete the active region between the mark
and the point, not include the isearch word."
